I saw this as a great opportunity to flex my dev-muscles so I decided to code it all myself using React for building the UI, Express to build the backend APIs, & MongoDB to persist my photo collections. My goal was also to remain 3rd party independent as possible when building the UI, therefore more than 90% of the components utilized are completely built by me.",

After communicating with some users on Reddit we agreed to make a website dedicated to help Arizona residents find available time-slots for the COVID-19 vaccine. My job was to build the UI & all corresponding functionality to help users find available time-slots as quickly as they could. Unfortunately many pharmacies blocked any external users from their APIs to get the information we needed to complete the project. Despite not having real data, I still wanted to showcase the work that was done & the vision that we had to help.",
